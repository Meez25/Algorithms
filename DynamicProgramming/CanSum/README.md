# CanSum

We are given a target number and a list of number, and we should tell if the target can be reached by adding any of the number in the list of numbers.

m = target
n = array length

Without cache :
- Time complexity : O(n^m)
- Space complexity : O(m)

With cache :
- Time complexity : O(n*m)
- Space complexity : O(m)
